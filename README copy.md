# STORE

This directory contains your Store files.

Vuex is a centralized store for all the **UI** components in an application,
with rules ensuring that the **UI** state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/).
